There are different approaches to AI, but many systems are based on machine learning algorithms, which allow computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.\n\nMachine learning involves the training of models on large datasets, so they can learn patterns and relationships within the data. There are various types of machine learning, including supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, and unsupervised learning, where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data.\n\nAI systems can also employ techniques like neural networks, which are inspired by the structure of the human brain and can learn complex patterns. Deep learning is a type of neural network that has multiple layers, allowing it to learn hierarchical representations of data.\n\nOverall, AI systems work by processing data through algorithms, learning from that data, and then making decisions or predictions based on what they have learned.

Cook the pasta according to the package instructions or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Keep in mind that different types of pasta will have different cooking times.\n5. Once the pasta is cooked, remove it from the heat and drain it in a colander.\n6.
