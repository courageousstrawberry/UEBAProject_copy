      "response": "Computers are electronic devices that process data based on instructions given to them. They work by receiving input data, processing that data using mathematical and logical operations, and then producing output based on the processed data. \n\nThe central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, responsible for carrying out the instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions.\n\nComputers use memory, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), to temporarily store data and program instructions that are currently in use. \n\nInput devices, such as keyboards and mice, allow users to input data and commands into the computer. Output devices, such as monitors and printers, display or output the results of the processed data.\n\nData is typically stored on storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, for long-term storage and retrieval.\n\nOverall, computers use a combination of hardware components and software programs to carry out complex tasks and perform a wide variety of functions.",
